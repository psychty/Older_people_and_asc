# Older people tend to move out of urban cities to rural areas.

# However adults moving to new areas to grow older often have to start anew with social support networks; which older adults who have lived there for longer will already have established. 

# So do we need to consider more than just those areas with more older people. Do some areas of West Sussex (or wider) have more older people flowing in. 

# Of course some people might move to a new area to be closer to family so this isn't fool proof and its also not particularly granular (only down to LTLA).

# this says census data but i cant find it
