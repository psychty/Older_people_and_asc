This is partly because there are more women than men in the total population aged 65 and over due to women’s higher life expectancy. By the age of 65, most women have been married and husbands are typically older than their wives. These two factors mean that more women than men become widowed, which may lead to living alone.

POPPI,Some hearing loss,Male,65-69,National prevalence applied,0.368,Adrian Davis,1995,"NOTE INCOMPATIBLE AGE BANDS Hearing loss and deafness is usually measured by finding the quietest sounds someone can hear using tones with different frequencies, which are heard as different pitches. The person being tested is asked to respond, usually by pressing a button, when they can hear a tone and the level of the tone is adjusted until they can just hear it. This level is called the threshold. Thresholds are measured in units called dBHL: dB stands for 'decibels' and HL stands for 'hearing level'. The greater the threshold level is in dBHL the worse the hearing loss.  Anyone with thresholds between 0 and 20 dBHL across all the frequencies is considered to have 'normal' hearing. The threshold of 25 dBHL indicates some hearing loss; the threshold of 65 dBHL indicates severe hearing loss. Evidence shows that hearing loss is a serious health condition that can have an adverse impact on a person’s health and quality of life, for example people with hearing loss may find it difficult communicate with other people and have an increased risk of social isolation and other problems such as anxiety, depression and dementia. People with hearing loss may also face barriers to employment due to poor deaf awareness or the lack of communication support. Hearing loss is a common long-term condition and is most cases is not remediable by medical intervention. The primary intervention for most people with hearing loss is hearing aids provided by audiologists. Some people with hearing loss may use British Sign Language (BSL) as their first or preferred language and may consider themselves part of the Deaf community, with a shared history, culture and language."

POPPI,Some hearing loss,Male,90+,National prevalence applied,0.934,Adrian Davis,1995,"NOTE INCOMPATIBLE AGE BANDS Hearing loss and deafness is usually measured by finding the quietest sounds someone can hear using tones with different frequencies, which are heard as different pitches. The person being tested is asked to respond, usually by pressing a button, when they can hear a tone and the level of the tone is adjusted until they can just hear it. This level is called the threshold. Thresholds are measured in units called dBHL: dB stands for 'decibels' and HL stands for 'hearing level'. The greater the threshold level is in dBHL the worse the hearing loss.  Anyone with thresholds between 0 and 20 dBHL across all the frequencies is considered to have 'normal' hearing. The threshold of 25 dBHL indicates some hearing loss; the threshold of 65 dBHL indicates severe hearing loss. Evidence shows that hearing loss is a serious health condition that can have an adverse impact on a person’s health and quality of life, for example people with hearing loss may find it difficult communicate with other people and have an increased risk of social isolation and other problems such as anxiety, depression and dementia.
